# EventEase

**EventEase** is a dynamic event management platform built using **ASP.NET Core MVC**. It allows users to create, manage, and participate in both public and private events. The application supports guest access for viewing public events and provides registered users with enhanced functionalities such as creating events, managing invitations, and categorizing events into past and upcoming sections.

## Project Purpose

The **EventEase** is designed to streamline the process of event creation and management. Whether youâ€™re planning a private gathering or a public meetup, this platform simplifies inviting attendees, tracking participation, and keeping a record of events. By categorizing events into past and upcoming, users can maintain a clean and organized view of their schedules and social plans. This project offers a user-friendly interface for guests, event organizers, and invitees, ensuring seamless interaction and participation in both public and private events.

## Key Features

- **Public & Private Events**: Users can create events that are visible to everyone (public) or restricted to invited guests (private).
- **Guest User Access**: Guest users can browse and view only public events, while private events remain hidden.
- **Logged-in User Functionality**: 
    - View public events.
    - Access a personalized "My Events" section, showcasing events created by the user.
    - View events they have been invited to in the "Invited Events" section.
- **Event Invitations**: Users can invite others to private events using their email addresses.
- **Upcoming and Past Events**: Events are divided into upcoming and past sections, making it easier for users to track future and completed events.
- **Event Management**: Users can:
  - **Update Events**: Modify details of both public and private events.
  - **Delete Events**: Remove upcoming events. For past events, users are allowed only to delete them.
- **Secure Access**: Role-based access control ensures that only authorized users can create and manage events.
